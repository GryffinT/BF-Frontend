# BF-Frontend v1.0.5 — 2026-01-30

This is the project's first official release and the first working build — v1.0.5. The sole, critical change in this release is a fix to the node-fetch integration so network requests function correctly. Everything else in this release is intended to be stable and usable.

## Highlights
- Patched node-fetch so server and client-side network requests work as expected.
- First working release of BF-Frontend — recommended baseline for all users.

## Fixes
- Fixed broken HTTP/fetch behavior by updating/patching our node-fetch usage and related request handling. This resolves failures that prevented the app from communicating with backend services.

## Upgrade notes
- This release is primarily a compatibility/bugfix release. To update:
  - Run `npm install` / `pnpm install` to ensure the patched dependency is installed.
  - Restart your dev server and clear any caches if you see stale behavior.
- If you rely on a pinned node-fetch version in your environment, ensure it matches the one included here or remove the pin so the patched version is used.

## Reporting issues & contributions
- If you hit any regressions or remaining network errors, please open an issue at: https://github.com/GryffinT/BF-Frontend/issues and include:
  - Node version, OS, steps to reproduce, and any error logs or stack traces.
- Thanks to everyone who helped test and verify this working release.
